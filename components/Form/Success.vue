                Your application has been successfully submitted. The Atria
                Purchasing Team will be in contact after theyâ€™ve had a chance to
                review your application. The average review process takes 14-30
                business days. This is not a guarantee of business, it simply
                starts the process if Atria is interested in the request
                submitted.
